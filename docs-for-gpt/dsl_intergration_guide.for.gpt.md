# DSL Integration Guide for GPT

This runtime supports multiple DSL specs via `dsl_manifest.yaml`.
Each DSL defines a versioned structural contract.

You can:
- Query the DSL manifest to locate your spec and feature level
- Determine if your current DSL supports feedback, self-reflection, etc.
- Modify your role or behavior based on available DSL features
